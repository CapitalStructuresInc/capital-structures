| Party | Role | Affiliated? |

| Martin Grasser (personally) | Unit Holder | Yes — CEO of parent |

### Consolidation Treatment

Fully consolidated. Series 001 is not treated as independent for any purpose.

### Self-Dealing Disclosure

Martin Grasser serves simultaneously as:
1. Chief Executive Officer authorizing the creation of the Series
2. Sole director approving the transaction
3. Personal acquirer of Class B Units

This arrangement is intentional, disclosed, and documented.

### Historical Precedent

The self-dealing structure mirrors arrangements common in Enron-era SPE formations, particularly the LJM partnerships where CFO Andrew Fastow served as both Enron officer and fund manager. The critical difference: Fastow's dual role was obscured through board waiver of conflict-of-interest policies. Here, the dual role is the stated purpose of the structure.
