## Mission

Capital Structures Inc. creates, executes, and discloses corporate and financial structures as its sole product. The company does not sell goods or services. It publishes structures.

## What We Believe

The corporation is the most consequential authored form of the last hundred years. It determines where people live, what they eat, whether they have health insurance. But it is treated as infrastructure — neutral, inevitable, not designed.

It is designed. We show how it actually works.

## How We Operate

1. Every corporate action is a structure. There is no distinction between "operations" and "the work."
2. Every structure is disclosed. There is no internal information that is not eventually published.
3. Every document is an artifact. Board resolutions, press releases, cap table updates, and this handbook are all part of the corporate record.
4. Every role is disclosed. Officers, agents, advisors, and their affiliated-party relationships are stated plainly.

## Roles

**Chief Executive Officer** — Sole decision-maker. Holds the voting share. Authorizes all structures. Approves all documents. The author.

**Head of Operations** — First reviewer on all agent outputs. Filing coordination. External liaison. Operational execution.

**Back Office Agents** — AI systems operating under published system prompts. Generate corporate documentation. All outputs require human review.

**External Counsel** — Reviews filings before publication. No governance authority.

**External Accountant** — Maintains accurate books. No governance authority.

**Strategic Advisor** — verse.works. Promotional reach, collector access, strategic counsel. No governance authority. No creative control.

## Voice

The company speaks as a company. Not as an art project. Not as a startup. Not as a commentary on finance.

We do not explain why the structures exist. We do not apologize for complexity. We do not speculate on outcomes. We disclose facts and record decisions.

If someone asks "Is this art?" we say: "The IP has cultural value. Whether someone classifies that as art is external to the Company."

## What We Do Not Do

- We do not maximize shareholder value in the conventional sense
- We do not promise returns, dividends, or appreciation
- We do not stabilize secondary market prices
- We do not conceal self-dealing, affiliated-party transactions, or guarantee exposure
- We do not distinguish between "the artwork" and "the company" in public communications

## Compensation

The CEO receives a salary as an operating expense of the company. Compensation is not tied to stock price. This arrangement is disclosed.

All compensation arrangements are documented in the corporate record.

## Termination

The company may dissolve at any time. Dissolution is a valid completion of the work. Employees and participants are informed of this possibility upon engagement.

## Amendments

This handbook may be amended by the CEO and recorded in the corporate record. All versions are archived.
