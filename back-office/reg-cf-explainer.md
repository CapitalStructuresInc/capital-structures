# HOW IT WORKS: REG CF
## A Plain-Language Explainer for verse.works

---

### What is Reg CF?

Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) is a U.S. securities law that lets small companies sell real shares to the public through online portals — without a full IPO. Think of it as Kickstarter, but instead of rewards, people get actual equity.

### Why Reg CF and not a traditional gallery sale?

Because what we're selling isn't an edition or a print. It's a position inside a corporate structure. That makes it a security under U.S. law. We can't legally sell securities without registering them — and Reg CF is the simplest, cheapest way to do that.

This is also conceptually essential: the work uses real securities law as medium. A Reg CF filing is itself a corporate action — a disclosed structure. The Form C we file with the SEC becomes part of the archive.

### How does the sale work?

1. Capital Structures Inc. lists on a Reg CF portal (Wefunder or Republic)
2. The listing describes the company, the risks, and what participants receive
3. Anyone can contribute — minimum likely $100–$500, adjustable
4. Each contribution triggers a new structure: a Protected Series under Delaware law
5. The participant receives Class B Units — real securities, documented and archived
6. There's a 1-year holding period before units can be traded on secondary markets

### What do participants receive?

Class B Units. These are real securities. They carry:
- **No voting rights** (Martin holds the sole voting share)
- **No dividends**
- **No liquidation preference**
- **Position inside a disclosed system** — their name on the cap table, their structure in the archive, their certificate printed and documented

In CEO voice: "They get position. Not return."

### What do participants NOT receive?

- Promise of appreciation
- Promise of profit
- Any management effort aimed at increasing value
- Buybacks, price support, or liquidity management

This is all stated plainly in the Form C. Total disclosure.

### How much can we raise?

Reg CF allows up to $5 million per year. We're targeting much less:
- Phase I goal: $100,000 (20 structures)
- Break-even: ~15 structures (~$75,000)

### What does the portal take?

Typically 7-8% of the raise. No upfront cost. They handle compliance, payment processing, and investor verification.

### Can people outside the U.S. participate?

Generally yes, though the portal may have restrictions. This is a question for securities counsel.

### What's verse.works' role?

verse.works is not selling the securities. The portal handles that. verse.works is:
1. **Institutional credibility** — your reputation validates the project to the portal and to participants
2. **Promotion** — reaching collectors who understand conceptual work
3. **Strategic counsel** — framing, audience, messaging

verse.works is documented as Structure 002: the company's first external relationship, disclosed as a corporate structure itself.

### What about secondary markets?

After the 1-year holding period, units can trade. We don't manage, support, or stabilize that market. If a secondary market develops and prices move — that's external. We publish structures. Markets do what markets do.

### How is this different from an NFT drop?

An NFT is a token. This is a registered security filed with the SEC. The legal framework, the disclosure obligations, the regulatory oversight — all real. That's the point. We're not simulating corporate infrastructure. We're operating inside it.

### What's the timeline?

1. Find securities counsel (now)
2. Draft and file Form C (4-6 weeks with counsel)
3. Portal compliance review (2-4 weeks)
4. Go live on portal
5. Structures created as contributions come in

### The bottom line for verse

This isn't a traditional art sale and it isn't a traditional startup raise. It's a real corporation selling real participation to real people, with full disclosure that it may never profit and may intentionally dissolve. The legal framework isn't a constraint on the art — it IS the art. Every form we file, every disclosure we make, every risk factor we enumerate is part of the work.
