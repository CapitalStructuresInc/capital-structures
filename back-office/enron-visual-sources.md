# ENRON VISUAL SOURCE GUIDE
## Where to Find the Original Documents

---

### 1. HAGLEY MUSEUM AND LIBRARY — Wilmington, Delaware

**Digital access:** https://digital.hagley.org/2487
Browse online. Many items have been digitized including scanned board minutes, presentation materials, and committee reports.

**Physical access:** Hagley Museum and Library, 200 Hagley Creek Road, Wilmington, DE 19807. askhagley@hagley.org / (302) 658-2400 ext. 275. Free to visit. Reading room access.

**Why this matters for design:** These are the actual documents that were presented to the Enron board. The typography, the layout, the PowerPoint formatting, the way financial structures were diagrammed for directors — this is the visual language of corporate governance in the late 1990s. Times New Roman, simple tables, black-and-white flow charts, dense bullet points. This is what institutional legitimacy looked like.

### 2. DOJ TRIAL EXHIBITS — Department of Justice

The government released all trial exhibits from U.S. v. Lay/Skilling in the format admitted in court.

**URL:** https://www.justice.gov/archive/index-enron.html

**What's there:**
- Government exhibits from the trial (thousands of documents)
- Prosecution demonstrations and visual aids (May 2006 demos)
- Internal Enron presentations shown to employees
- Conference call transcripts (Skilling's voice in text form)
- The verdict slips (handwritten GUILTY in cursive)
- Maps of executive offices at Enron HQ
- Employee presentations (the ones dripping with irony in retrospect)

**Why this matters for design:** The prosecution's visual aids translated complex SPE structures into courtroom diagrams. The employee presentations show Enron's internal design language — how they presented themselves to their own people. Corporate optimism rendered in PowerPoint.

### 3. POWERS REPORT — Full PDF

The 218-page Report of Investigation by the Special Investigative Committee. This is where the SPE structure diagrams live.

**URL:** http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/02/02/enron.report/powers.report.pdf
**Also at:** SEC EDGAR (search Enron Corp, Exhibit 99.2)

**What's there:**
- Transaction diagrams for Chewco, LJM1, LJM2, Raptors I–IV
- Flow-of-funds diagrams
- Entity relationship charts
- The specific visual language of how financial structures are diagrammed in legal/investigative contexts — boxes, arrows, dotted lines for guarantees, solid lines for ownership

**Why this matters for design:** The Powers Report diagrams are the Rosetta Stone. They show how lawyers and investigators visualize the exact structures you're building. The style is deliberately plain — boxes, lines, labels. No decoration. No branding. Just structure made visible. This is the aesthetic precedent for your structure diagrams.

### 4. FERC ENRON INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTS

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released massive datasets including over 85,000 scanned documents and 150,000+ scanned pages.

**URL:** https://www.ferc.gov/electric/industry-activities/addressing-2000-2001-western-energy-crisis/information-released-enron-investigation

### 5. ENRON EMAIL CORPUS

The most famous corporate email dataset in history. 600,000+ emails from 158 employees. Released by FERC. Became the foundation for early NLP and machine learning research.

**Primary source:** http://enrondata.org/ (148 PSTs by custodian with folder structure)
**Also at:** Carnegie Mellon University dataset, various academic mirrors

**Why this matters:** Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain's "The Good Life" (New Museum/Rhizome) repackaged the Enron emails as a 7-year subscription — you received the entire corpus, one email at a time. Artistic precedent for using Enron's disclosed data as medium.

### DESIGN NOTES

**The visual language to study:**

1. **Board presentation decks** (Hagley): Late-90s PowerPoint. Blue/white color schemes. Simple org charts. Dense bullet points. Times New Roman or Arial. This is the authentic visual language of corporate governance.

2. **Powers Report diagrams**: Boxes and arrows. Entity names in boxes. Ownership lines solid, guarantee lines dotted. Dollar amounts on flow arrows. Black and white. No color. This is how lawyers see structures.

3. **Trial exhibit boards**: Large-format, high-contrast. Simplified for a jury. Key numbers highlighted. These show how complex structures get compressed into visual clarity.

4. **Enron annual reports** (Hagley digital): The polished public face. Glossy corporate photography. Aspirational language. The gap between these and the internal documents is the gap your project makes visible.

5. **Internal memos and emails** (FERC/Enron corpus): The real voice. Casual, operational, sometimes panicked. The tone behind the polish. This is where "Skilling-calm" breaks down.

**Your visual position:** Not the polished annual report. Not the simplified trial exhibit. The structure diagram — the Powers Report style. Boxes, lines, labels. Structure made visible, in the plainest possible form. 188 Sans instead of Times New Roman. Black and white. No decoration. The diagram IS the product.
