# CAPITAL STRUCTURES INC.
## Brief for Securities Counsel

---

### Engagement Summary

Capital Structures Inc. is a Delaware C-Corporation seeking counsel for a Regulation Crowdfunding offering. The company's sole product is the creation, execution, and disclosure of corporate and financial structures. The company is also a conceptual art project — but this does not alter the legal requirements. All structures are real, all securities are real, all filings must be compliant.

We need counsel who understands Reg CF and is comfortable with a client whose charter explicitly prioritizes cultural production over profit maximization.

---

### What the Company Does

The company creates corporate structures — Protected Series under a Delaware Series LLC, governance actions, options, swaps, guarantees — and publishes the complete documentation as its product. There is no other revenue source. No goods. No services.

The structures are modeled on historical financial engineering (SPEs, hedging vehicles, prepay structures) but operate with complete transparency and full consolidation. Nothing is off-balance-sheet in any undisclosed sense.

### What We Need

1. **Charter review and drafting**
   - Certificate of Incorporation includes an "Artistic Fiduciary Doctrine" — a modification of fiduciary duty stating that management prioritizes cultural production and conceptual coherence over profit maximization
   - This must be legally sound under Delaware law
   - We understand B-Corp and PBC structures exist but believe a standard C-Corp with modified charter language is more appropriate — we welcome counsel's view

2. **Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) offering**
   - Form C preparation and filing
   - Securities being offered: Class B Units in Protected Series under a Delaware Series LLC
   - Class B Units carry no voting rights, no dividends, no liquidation preference
   - Target raise: $100,000 (20 units at approximately $500–$1,000 each, pricing TBD)
   - Portal: Wefunder or Republic (conversations not yet started)
   - Risk factors must include: total loss, no revenue, intentional non-optimization, possible dissolution, management not incentivized to increase value

3. **Series LLC formation**
   - Delaware Series LLC to house Protected Series
   - Each structure creates a new Protected Series
   - Template operating agreement for series creation

4. **Template documents**
   - Class B Unit purchase agreement
   - Board resolution template for structure authorization
   - Guarantee agreement template (parent guarantees series performance)
   - Advisory agreement (for external strategic advisor relationship)

5. **Ongoing review**
   - The company uses AI agents to generate corporate documentation (press releases, board resolutions, structure briefs). All agent outputs require counsel review before filing or publication.
   - Quarterly review cadence anticipated

### What We Are NOT Asking For

- We are not asking counsel to opine on whether this is art
- We are not asking for reduced-fee "pro bono" work
- We are not seeking novel legal structures — everything here uses standard corporate and securities law
- We are not trying to evade any regulations — full compliance is part of the work

### Key Disclosures

- The sole director and CEO (Martin Grasser) is also the artist. This is disclosed.
- The CEO will personally acquire Class B Units in Structure 001, creating a self-dealing arrangement. This is disclosed.
- The Head of Operations (Audrey Chen) is a concurrent employee of the CEO's design studio (andrepeat.com). This is disclosed.
- The company's strategic advisor (verse.works) is an art gallery. This is disclosed.
- The company may intentionally dissolve at any time. This is disclosed.
- Management compensation is not tied to stock price or company performance. This is disclosed.

### Budget

We have approximately $3,000–$5,000 allocated for initial legal work (charter + Form C + templates). We understand this is lean and are prepared to prioritize: charter and Form C first, templates second.
